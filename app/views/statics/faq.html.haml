    %a{href:"#panel1a"} You'll take me to Napa for free??
    %div{id:"panel1a", class: "content active"}
      Yup.

  %li{class: "accordion-navigation"}
    %a{href: "#panel2a"} How does this work?
    %div{id:"panel2a", class: "content"}
      It's very simple. I take you to Napa or Sonoma for a day to experience wines at some of the best wineries in the world...at no cost to you. All I ask is that you purchase $100 worth of wine, per person, on the trip.

  %li{class: "accordion-navigation"}
    %a{href: "#panel3a"} I thought this was a free trip. Why do I need to buy wine?
    %div{id:"panel3a", class: "content"}
      In order for us to keep doing this, wineries need to succceed. The only way they do that is by customers purchasing wine. At $100 per person this is cheaper than any other tour in the area AND you'll get to take home bottles of wine you enjoyed!


  %li{class: "accordion-navigation"}
    %a{href: "#panel4a"} Can I still participate if I'm not from the Bay Area?
    %div{id:"panel4a", class: "content"}
      If you can get to the Bay Area, Sonoma, Napa, or anywhere in between I'd be happy to have you.


  %li{class: "accordion-navigation"}
    %a{href: "#panel5a"} Can I ship wines back home?
    %div{id:"panel5a", class: "content"}
      This depends on where you live. If you don't live in California we can discuss your options before you make any purchasing decisions.


  %li{class: "accordion-navigation"}
    %a{href: "#panel6a"} How do we get up there?
    %div{id:"panel6a", class: "content"}
      We'll be driving up from the Bay Area in a full-size sedan, crossover, or SUV. All of our cars are clean and no older than a year. Some even have WiFi!


  %li{class: "accordion-navigation"}
    %a{href: "#panel7a"} Wait your cars have WiFi!?!
    %div{id:"panel7a", class: "content"}
      Some. Although this comes at an extra cost of $50 for the day. And we'll drive up in an Audi :)
